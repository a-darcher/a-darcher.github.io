	<p class="lead"> For several years before beginning my graduate studies in neuroscience, I pursued a career in bread and pastry baking. </p>


	<p>I got my start as a bread baker with the amazing <a href="http://www.bluescorcher.coop/">Blue Scorcher Bakery and Cafe</a> in Astoria, Oregon, USA. My last position before starting my masters was with <a href="https://www.butterandcream.com/">Butter and Cream</a> in Atlanta, Georgia (<a href="https://www.ajc.com/lifestyles/winner-best-ice-cream-metro-atlanta-best-atlanta/Dhka9yk3XxI6OElOpLDVdJ/">voted 2019's best in Atlanta!</a>).</p>
